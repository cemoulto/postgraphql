/**
 * A relation represents a directed edge between the keys of values in two
 * different collections.
 *
 * The values in the “tail” collection will be able to provide a key for a
 * value in the “head” collection. In a more visual language you could think of
 * it like this:
 *
 * ```
 * tail => head
 * ```
 *
 * The “tail” would be the “many” in a many-to-one relation and the “head”
 * would be the “one” in a many-to-one relation.
 *
 * So for example, say we had a `post` collection and a `person` collection.
 * Let’s also say that the `post` collection has an `author` field which is a
 * collection key for the `person` collection. In this case where `post` is
 * related to `person,` `post` is the tail collection and `person` is the head
 * collection.
 *
 * Or in relational database terms: a `post` table with an `author_id` column
 * and a `person` table with an `id` column. The `post` table is the tail and
 * the `person` table is the head.
 *
